Hey folks, as I've been building my blog for a while, I decided to write a
series to help you build and deploy a blog **completely for free** using
[Next.js], [Tailwind CSS], [MDX], and [Vercel].

> Another how-to build a blog, in 2021, really? Well, yes, but it is **quite
> more than that**.

## What's special?

Getting started to build a blog or personal website nowadays is easy.
Nevertheless, to get your blog **competent** in this "easy" world, there are a
lot of things to figure out:

- Search engine optimization (SEO).

- [Lighthouse] optimization.

- [Web vitals] optimization.

- Open graph, social cards (images) generation.

- Automated distribution and mentions: auto transpile and crosspost to different
  platforms, scheduled (re)shares or mentions on social networks.

- Social features: comments, discuss on Twitter, discuss on Github, etc.

- Newsletter.
