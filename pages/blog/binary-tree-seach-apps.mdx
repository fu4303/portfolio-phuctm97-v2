# Binary Search Tree And Real-world Applications

## Definition

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure that has

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the
  node's value.

- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the
  node's value.

- The left and right subtree each is a binary search tree, too.

## Real-world Applications

### 3D game engines

Almost every 3D engine uses BST to determine which objects should be rendered in
a 3D world, which is basically buffering Z orders instead of recalculating
complex 3D positioning on every render.

It's famously used in Doom 1993 as the first time a BST had even been used in a
game.

### Compilers

To efficiently parse syntax expressions (e.g. programming languages), compilers
use a special BST called syntax tree.
