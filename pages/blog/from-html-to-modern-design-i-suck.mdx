# Upgrade My Blog From Plain HTML to "Well-Designed" In 2 Weeks. I Suck.

About 3 weeks ago, I started [my blog in plain HTML][first blog], then gradually
tried to make it look better and more modern-ish. It has been 2 weeks so far and
I've never liked how my website looked only until today.

[Checkout my website](/) if you want to see how it looks first.

## 2 weeks was too long...

2 weeks ago, if anyone said to me that it's going to take 2 weeks to make a blog
look good, I'd definitely say back _"It's way too long man, it shouldn't take
that long!"_. And yeah, it took me 2 weeks and I've been saying that to myself
every single day in the last 2 weeks. It didn't feel good at all, it felt like
years.

So what's wrong?

## It always "looks" better in my imagination

When I first talked to myself that I'm going to make my website look better, I
**could immediately have an imagination** inside my head about how it were going
to look amazing and how easy it were to implement it - just put some CSS and
that's it.

The problem with my imagination was that things looked good because I believed
they were gonna look good, not because every single detail in it actually looked
good. There were no detail in my imagination, literally zero detail.

_(Try this yourself, remember the last time that you imagined you were going to
make something beautiful, try to go into details of that "beautiful" thingy and
see if you know what every single detail really looked like)_

When I started to sit down and write some code, I had to face the details that
never existed in my mind. There was no surprise, I had no idea how each element
should look, _especially when sitting next to each other_. I ended up just
trying lots of different combinations and they all just looked bad!

## Looking for inspiration

Being stuck and feeling like I'm the worst developer in the world, I decided to
look for some inspiration and then maybe just copy-paste to save my life.

Then, I realized that my imagination was really just the style of how I want my
website to look. I ended up with the following list:

- [Vercel]
- [Next.js]
- [Tanica Rascia]
- [Lee Robinson]

These websites roughly describe my imagination.

## The trap of inspiration

Having an inspiration helped to sharpen the details of my imagination, like a
button, a paragraph, a title, or a form.

I thought that I were going to make it this time but I fell into another trap:

> I don't want my website to look exactly the same as any of these websites, but
> it should look similar.

So, I put pieces from this and pieces from that into my website, and guess what,
my website became a mess.

> F\*ck! It was all because of these websites, I shouldn't use in the first
> place, I should have come up with my design system.

_(LoL, I'm laughing at myself writing this now, my thinking process was just so
weird)_

## A way out

You may have thought that I was just kidding about dropping the inspiration
sites, but I actually did it. However, I didn't start any design system, it was
just an overkill doing so, and you've probably realized that there's no way I
could build a design system myself now.

What I did was just to think about my website's design systematically. What it
means is to start with layout first, what sections my site should have, then
what content each section should display and why. Then for each section, I
implement it separately, if a section is too big, I break it down into multiple
elements again and repeat the same process. The key point of this method is to
not allow you to overthink about the details, just imagine the site as a set of
black boxes and your design job is to put these black boxes together, you'll go
into each box later. Once you've done, you don't go back.

Alright, that's it, there are more specific knowledge into building the actual
site, but it was late now and I wanted to focus on the design part in this
article. Hope you enjoy the story and learn something from it!
