# Reverse-engineer A No-code Website Builder

## What and why?

No-code is becoming a big part of modern product development, it encourages an
agile approach and accelerates iterations. Understanding how a no-code tool is
built can be an advantage for a developer.

In this article, I'm going to analyze Carrd.co, a service for building
responsive one-page sites, break it down into components to briefly see how a
similar product can be built.

## The Output

First, let's look at what can be made using Carrd.

### Personal sites

### Landing pages

_(See in details at carrd.co/build)_

Essentially, the output you can get from Carrd is simple yet beautiful and
responsive personal sites and landing pages.

## Design Concept

Every no-code builder has a design concept, which is basically how its outputs
are structured so that they can be built, serialized (saved to disk), and
reproduced (rendered on screen).

For Carrd, there're 4 primary concepts:

- **Site**: deployment configuration of a site such as title, description,
  language, domain, SSL certificates, Google analytics, etc. In software
  engineering, _Site_ is basically a configuration file for DevOps automation.

- **Background**: each _Site_ has a _Background_ component, which sits behind
  all of a site's elements. When rendering on browsers, _Background_ is
  technically a mapping to CSS `background` property of HTML `body`, which can
  be styled to show either a solid color, a gradient, an image, or a video.

- **Page**: the container of all of a site's elements (except for _Background_).
  _Page_ defines how a site's overall layout looks, how elements should be
  aligned to each other. A _Page_ can also be styled and positioned to show like
  a card or a window. When rendering on browsers, _Page_ is technically a
  top-level `div`.

- **Element**: a widget on a _Page_ such as _Text_, _Image_, _Button_, etc.
  Carrd has about 18 different types of elements. Each element has several
  properties that can be configured to change its behavior and look-and-feel.
  When rendering on browsers, each element is technically a mapping to a set of
  HTML elements and CSS styles.

## Implementation Components

If you've experienced enough with a component-based front-end framework (React,
Vue, etc), you may already recognize that Carrd is essentially a components
library and a builder UI tailor-made for it.

Yeah, that's exactly it. However, to make it a full-blown product for
non-developer users, we'll need a couple of other components. In a word, we'll
need:

- **Components Library and Compiler**: together define what elements are
  available for uses, how they are compiled into HTML/CSS/JS (or other
  presentations if you're building for platforms other than web).

- **Builder**: a graphical user interface application that allows users to pull
  elements together **visually**, instead of writing code.

- **Serializer**: a service that writes what users built visually with _Builder_
  into disks (database, text files, etc) and vice versa.

- **Publisher**: a service that publishes a site's output along with its
  configurations to a hosting or distribution channel (Amazon S3, Vercel, etc).

- **Dashboard**: the UI for managing one's account, sites, and stuff other than
  building.

- **Homepage**: the website itself, including its logo, landing page, signup
  page, etc.
